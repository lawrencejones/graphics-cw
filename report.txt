Currently each fragments color value is calculated as a sum of the texture color, plus lightening from diffuse and specular shading.
The diffuse and specular shading add light equally to all rgb components, meaning that the texture value at each fragment has no effect on the magnitude of the illumination.
To increase realism, we could compute the final fragment color value by finding a proportional affect of an illumination on the fragment, given that a blue fragment will reflect (proportionally) more blue diffuse and specular illumination.
In this way, our teapot would appear to more accurately model real life reflection, by taking the texture color into account when shading.
